# リー – Dreaming

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Your voice is a perfect chorus
Your words, a melody I can't
forget
Your name is heaven on my lips
I can't blame these feelings on
the cheap fernet
I want what's simple
I just want us
Holding my breath
Making wishes in my head
I wanted so badly, to kiss you
instead
You kept talking and talking
Can't recall what you said.
I fell in love
but you were just dreaming out
loud
Stay here, please don't go
anywhere
We've got wolves at the door
Always hungry for more
I want what's simple
I want your love
Holding my breath
Making wishes in my head
I wanted so badly, to kiss you
instead
You kept talking and talking
Can't recall what you said
I fell in love
But you were just dreaming out
loud
Baby please wake up
I'm in over my head
So please
Baby wake up
Holding my breath
Counting backwards from ten
I want you so badly
Why can't you see it
You keep talking, stop talking
and just take my hand
I'm so in love with you
Maybe I'm dreaming out loud
Baby wake up
I'm so in love with you
Maybe we're dreaming out loud
