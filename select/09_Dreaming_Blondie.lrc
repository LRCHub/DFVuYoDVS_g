[00:26.59] When I met you in the restaurant
[00:32.76] You could tell I was no débutante
[00:39.93] You asked me what's my pleasure
[00:43.33] A movie or a measure
[00:46.05] I'll have a cup of tea
[00:49.00] And tell you of my dreaming
[00:53.51] Dreaming is free
[00:57.04] Dreaming
[00:59.70] Dreaming is free
[01:07.70] 
[01:03.04] I don't want to live on charity
[01:08.52] Pleasure's real or is it fantasy
[01:14.87] Real to real is living rarity
[01:19.11] People stop and stare at me
[01:22.13] We just walk on by
[01:25.02] We just keep on dreaming
[01:37.02] 
[01:29.33] Feet, feet, walking a two mile
[01:33.21] Meet, meet, meet me at the turnstile
[01:35.24] I never met him
[01:37.98] I'll never forget him
[01:41.50] Dream, dream, even for a little while
[01:44.38] Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour
[01:47.18] Fade away
[01:50.25] Radiate
[01:53.75] 
[01:56.44] I sit by and watch the river flow
[02:02.59] I sit by and watch the traffic go
[02:08.44] Imagine something of your very own
[02:12.92] Something you can have and hold
[02:15.19] I'd build a road in gold
[02:18.65] Just to have some dreaming
[02:22.82] Dreaming is free
[02:26.32] Dreaming
[02:28.84] Dreaming is free
[02:31.98] Dreaming
[02:35.15] Dreaming is free
[02:43.15] 
[02:41.08] Dreaming is free
